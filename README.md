# rul_using_CNN_LSTM

As a part of my research work at DAIICT, this project aims at predicting the remaining useful life of a machine based on the historical time series data of its performance. We used NASA's jet engine data-set to build and test our model. We implemented several different Machine Learning and Deep learning algorithms out of which CNN with LSTM gave the best evaluation score.
